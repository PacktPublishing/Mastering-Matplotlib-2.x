**Effective Data Visualization techniques with Python**

## What is this book about?

In this book, you’ll get hands-on with customizing your data plots with the help of Matplotlib. You’ll start with customizing plots, making a handful of special-purpose plots, and building 3D plots. You’ll explore non-trivial layouts, Pylab customization, and more about tile configuration. You’ll be able to add text, put lines in plots, and also handle polygons, shapes, and annotations. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Deal with non-trivial and unusual plots
* Understanding Basemap methods
* Customize and represent data in 3D
* Construct Non-Cartesian and vector plots
* Design interactive plots using Jupyter Notebook

## Get to Know the Author
**Benjamin Walter Keller** is currently a PhD candidate at McMaster University and gained his BSc in physics with a minor in computer science from the University of Calgary in 2011. His current research involves numerical modeling of galaxy evolution over cosmological timescales. As an undergraduate at the U of C, he worked on stacking radio polarization to examine faint extragalactic sources. He also worked in the POSSUM Working Group 2 to determine the requirements for stacking applications for the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope. He is particularly interested in questions involving stellar feedback (supernovae, stellar winds, and so on) and its impact on galaxies and their surrounding intergalactic medium.
